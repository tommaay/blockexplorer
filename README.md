## Basic block explorer using Next.JS and Alchemy SDK

### Description

This has basic functionality of getting the last 10 blocks and displaying it in a table on the home screen. If you click on a block it will take you to a details page with more information.
I didn't add any UI enhancements like loaders and stuff this was just to test the Alchemy SDK and complete the challenge. I may revisit this and build a complete block explorer in the future.
